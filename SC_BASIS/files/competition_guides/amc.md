#AMC:
The AMC (American Mathematics Competition) is the biggest math competition in the US and maybe in the world. It is the very first stage of the US IMO team selection, and it usually takes place in February. There are three levels of the competition: AMC 8, AMC 10, and AMC 12. For x=8, 10, 12, students are eligible for AMC x if their grade is less than or equal to x. AMC 8/10/12 are all multiple choice tests, each with 25 questions that are arranged with increasing difficulty. 
AMC 8 has a time limit of 40 minutes and all the questions are worth 1 point each if answered correctly and 0 if answered wrong. 

AMC 10/12 has a time limit of 75 minutes. Each question is worth 6 points if answered correctly, 1.5 points if left unanswered, and 0 point if answered wrong. This is quite interesting because the expected value of the score of not answering (1.5) is actually higher than the expected value of the score of guessing the answer (6/5=1.2) (unless the student can confidently eliminate some answer choices). 

The level of AMC is relatively low when comparing to many other math competitions. The competition tests students’ ability to solve basic problems in Algebra, Geometry, Number theory, and Combinatorics. The top 2.5% of AMC 10 participants and the top 5% of AMC 12 participants will qualify for the next round of competition, AIME. The cutoff line of AMC 10 is usually between 110 and 120, and the cutoff line of AMC 12 is usually between 90 and 100.

#AIME: 
The AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination) is the next stage of the US IMO team selection (unfortunately, students who do not go to school in US and do not have US citizenship are not allowed to participate in further competitions after AIME). 
AIME usually happens in March. AIME is a fill-in-the-blank test with 15 problems and a time limit of 3 hours. Each problem has an answer that is within the range 000 to 999. Each problem is worth 1 points if answered correctly, or 0 point if answered wrong. The problems in AIME are more difficult than the ones in AMC 10/12. In order to do well on AIME, students must be proficient in high-school math and have the knowledge to solve some intermediate math problems that are not taught in school. For students eligible for further competitions, their AMC 10/12 scores and AIME scores multiplied by 10 will be added to get a total score. The top 400-500 will qualify for the next round, USA(J)MO (AMC 10 students will take USAJMO and AMC 12 students will take USAMO).


##My advice on practicing AMC/AIME:
Practice makes perfect. This rule can be applied in almost everything, including math competitions. In order to succeed, you must practice a lot of contest problems, unless you are extremely talented. There are also some rules to follow when practicing. You should only give up on a problem if you do your best on trying to solve the problem but you still fail. By following this rule, you will maximize your chance of figuring out the solutions of problems on your own. This is really beneficial as solving a problem on your own consolidates your understanding of the concept. If you look at the solution before trying to solve the problem as best as you can, then the learning becomes passive instead of active. Also, it is important to take notes on the problems you answered wrong. By taking notes, you will remember the concepts that you have misunderstood or have made an error on before. 


Also, Olympiad math consists of these four topics: Algebra, Geometry, Number theory, and Combinatorics. I recommend students who are taking AMC/AIME to first consolidate their skills in algebraic manipulations (algebra) and familiarize with geometric figures (geometry) before practicing number theory and combinatorics. This is because the two latter topics are harder than the other two topics in AMC/AIME, and students do not get to learn number theory and combinatorics concepts in math classes at school.


##Here is my recommendation on math competition resources:

###Online:
- artofproblemsolving.com
    This website has the most complete collection of contest problems of AMC/AIME and all the other math competitions in the world. I often use this website to find some problems to solve. This website also has a forum where people around the world discuss problems in math contests. I sometimes enter the forum to discuss problems (including AMC/AIME) with people.
    Khan Academy
- I actually do not use Khan Academy to study math anymore. However, I think it is still good enough to help students practice introductory competitions such as AMC/AIME.

###Books: 
- The Art of Problem Solving Series
    These books cover all the concepts that appear in AMC/AIME. However, these books contain information that is not quite related to math competitions, and it takes a lot of effort to study the entire series.
