Scored a 5 on the AP European History Exam

Ms. Gillette
Many years of experience in teaching European History and World History and has was selected as a AP test grader in the previous years.
AP European History is a required 10th grade humanities course to take in Basis. 

This is a knowledge-based course that does not have prerequisites. It studies the cultural, economic, political, and social developments that have shaped Europe from c. 1450 to the present. You will analyze texts, visual sources, and other historical evidence and write essays expressing historical arguments.

###This is the course outline from CollegeBoard:
​
Unit 1: Renaissance and Exploration
Unit 2: Age of Reformation
Unit 3: Absolutism and Constitutionalism
Unit 4: Scientific, Philosophical, and Political Developments
Unit 5: Conflict, Crisis, and Reaction in the Late 18th Century
Unit 6: Industrialization and Its Effects
Unit 7: 19th-Century Perspectives and Political Developments
Unit 8: 20th-Century Global Conflicts
Unit 9: Cold War and Contemporary Europe

##Tips:

AP European History doesn’t really test on the details compared to other history courses (details are still important for high scores). It’s more about the big concepts, trends across periods, and a lot of comparisons.

You can also study the key concepts (available on the College board website or ask your teacher), and if you understand every one of them then you basically understand all the content. 

##Resources:

- ​The Multiple Choice Questions on Albert (link is included below) were helpful for me. It helped me to practice the AP-style questions on specific fields (historical periods) that you need to work on.

- Tom Richey's website and videos are really great sources of information (links are included below). They are for review and give you further understanding of content that you are struggling with. I didn’t really utilize prep-books for AP Euro, but you can go to some second-hand book WeChat groups to look for cheap books. They mainly serve the purpose of rapid review of all of the content (covers the entire course by periods in a concise manner).

- The exam structure is standard for a history test. For more details, please check the link below:

##Resource Recommendation from Ms. Gillette:

1. Princeton Review AP European History:
Recommendation reason: A lot of students have also preferred Princeton Review over the 5 steps to a 5, because it covers the content for the MCQ part of the exam, while the 5 steps to a 5 is only enough for the FRQ portion of the exam. 

2. AP Euro Crash Course:
Recommendation reason: This provides a very nice outline to the course, a tip when using this book is to "fill in info for the things you feel you need help with".

3. AP Central's course outline:
It breaks down each unit into objectives and also gives suggestions about topics which fit each unit. I usually give my students this unit by unit. Basically, what we are told as teachers is that if it is not in this document it won’t be on the test
