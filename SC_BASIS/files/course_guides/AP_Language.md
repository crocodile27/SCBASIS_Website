##Course Introduction:
​AP English Language and Composition is one of the two English courses of the CollegeBoard. As opposed to the AP Lit exam, APLang focuses more on the art of argumentation, and requires students to develop skills on rhetorical analysis and composition. All reading materials in APLang course are not fictional, and may include speeches, editorials, biographies, memoirs, satire, etc. It’s important for you to familiarize yourselves with all these forms of non-fictional work before the exam. 

The most essential skill in APLang is rhetorical analysis of arguments. Some of you might have heard of the book “Everything is an Argument”, and indeed, your teacher will tell you that almost everything you analyze in the class are unique arguments. In the APLang course, the analysis of arguments could be essentially broken down into few parts: syntax, diction, tone, figurative devices, and general composition of the passage/speech. I won’t be digging into each of them, as you will understand these strategies fairly well after a year of learning. But just keep in mind, these are the things that you can talk about in a rhetorical analysis or be utilized by yourselves in composing your own arguments. This being said, you will be required to read a copious amount of nonfictional works. Some of them might be exceptionally difficult to understand (like White Album), while others are boring to read. I have to tell you that there will be no way out besides from accepting the arduous task of reading these. So yeah, be prepared to give hard work!

##Exam Breakdown:
The exam is broken down into two large sections, the MCQ and the FRQs. You will have 1 hr to complete 45 multiple choice questions, have a break, and finish three FRQs in 135 minutes. It is suggested you put equal weight on each FRQ by allocating 45 minutes to each, but you do have the freedom to choose which one to write first or change your allocation of time.

To get a clear picture of what the MCQ requires from you, I suggest you go online and look at some real questions yourself, as there are many ways a question can be asked. 

The three FRQs, on the other hand, each have very specific requirements. The three essays are, respectively, synthesis, rhetorical analysis, and argument, and they are scored on a 1 to 9 scale. The requirements of each essay is listed on the CollegeBoard website. You can also have access to more than 20 sets of the FRQ that has appeared on past exams. The rhetorical analysis essay requires rhetorical analysis skills, as its name implies, and the argument essay requires your outside knowledge and ability to compose a complex argument. The synthesis essay, on the other hand, requires you to both analyze the documents, form you argument, and support your argument based on the documents. Thus, synthesis essay is generally considered the harder one. But you might have different strengths and weaknesses than others. Spend more time on your weaker essay.

##Tips:

Build a knowledge base. This could include books (non-fictional), philosophical or religious ideas, historical knowledge. These are probably the best evidence you could use to support your argument essay. It also means to take advantage of your history course. In many cases, you can easily support you argument essay with one or more than one historical development you have learned in class.

Do practice MCQs early in the year. These doesn’t have to be real AP questions, as you can find APLang MCQ practice online or from books like 5 Steps to a 5: 500 AP English Language Questions to Know by Test Day. Improving your MCQ score needs long-term practice.

Go and look at high-scoring essay on CollegeBoard website (8 or 9). There are certain language elements and composition strategies in these essays which you can directly use in your own essay. I would say sometimes reading one of these essays is even more helpful than writing two on your own.

Search for APLang glossary of rhetorical and literary devices online and just remember what each of them are. This is definitely for MCQs and beneficial when it comes to you trying to find rhetorical elements in the rhetorical analysis essay.

Build an advanced vocabulary base. This one is not about remembering thousands of vocabulary so that you can understand articles better (this is of course important, and you can try do this). In fact, I mean that you should have a functional high-tier vocabulary base of about 150-300 words that can help you improving your language in essays. I personally suggest simply remembering the vocabulary on Vocabulary Power Plus for SAT.​
