AP Human Geography
Anthea Guo
Human Geography Student of the Year 2019
Scored a 5 on the AP test
This course was one of the most interesting for me, it talks about how the people shape the world.

##Content:
AP HUG is mostly a theory and vocabulary based course,  you will be required to learn spacial and map analysis skills.
You will also need to memorize the types of maps, data on maps and certain trends that occur in different regions around the world.​​

##Course Difficulty:
- **Test load**: There were a lot of concepts and theories we needed to revise. Quizlet is pretty useful at this time, while a models/theories review guide (https://fiveable.me/hug/ap-human-geo-models-theories/) would also be very helpful. 
There is a lot of vocabulary, but there isn't much sophisticated language.
- **AP test scores**: The test scores might be lower compared to other humanities, but from what I heard, most people got a 4 or a 5 on the AP test.

##Tips:

#Things to know:
- Important maps
- Language trees
- Know where certain phenomenons occur(e.g. where horticulture, ranching, pastoral nomadism are dominant)

- Don’t be satisfied with textbook examples, know not just one forward capital but all of the forward capitals and know not just one primate city but all of the primate cities around the world.

- For the FRQ part of the test, I would advise you to use minimum amounts of abbreviations, and explain all concepts/vocabulary that is not everyday language.

- Practice before the test. I practically looked through a lot of past year FRQ answer keys before the test.

#Resources: (ranked in order)
1. **AMSCO** - the textbook doesn’t include all theories or sometimes doesn’t do much explaining on the pros and cons of a concept, this book really helped us on doing that. It is best to have one copy for yourself so you can look at it when doing HUG (human geography homework)
2. **Phone Apps**: (a secret note) I usually do practice questions on my phone on the metro on an APP called human geography and then take screenshots of the ones I missed and review them in depth when I get home.
3. **Geography 4 Geographers**: http://www.geographyforgeographers.com/human-geography-resources.html, This is a really good website with heaps of good links and documents that might come in useful.
4. **National Geographic** AP HUG resources:https://www.nationalgeographic.org/education/ap-human-geography/, this website has a lot of articles for extra knowledge for each chapters, if you have the extra curiosity.
5. **Planning Tank**: https://planningtank.com/?s=city+model, this website has a full explanation for all the city models for better understanding. Use when studying city models.
6. **World Fact Book**: https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/ if your looking for the GDP (Gross Domestic Product), PPP (Purchasing Power Parity)
