#​Content

According to the CollegeBoard, AP Computer Science A is an introductory college-level computer science course. Students cultivate their understanding of coding through analyzing, writing, and testing code as they explore concepts like modularity, variables, and control structures.

Based on the Understanding by Design® (Wiggins and McTighe) model, this course framework provides a description of the course requirements necessary for students' success, with a focus on big ideas that encompasses core principles, theories, and processes of the discipline. The framework also encourages instruction that prepares students for advanced computer science coursework and its integration into a wide array of STEM-related fields.
 
The AP Computer Science A framework is organized into 10 commonly taught units of study that provide a possible sequence for the course. As always, you have the flexibility to organize the course content as you like.
 
- Unit 1: Primitive Types   2.5%-5%
- Unit 2: Using Objects   5%-7.5%
- Unit 3: Boolean Expressions and if Statements   15%-17.5%
- Unit 4: Iteration   17.5%-22.5%
- Unit 5: Writing Classes   5%-7.5%
- Unit 6: Array   10%-15%
- Unit 7: ArrayList   2.5%-7.5%
- Unit 8: 2D Array   7.5%-10%
- Unit 9: Inheritance   5%-10%
- Unit 10: Recursion   5%-7.5%

##Computational Thinking Practices: 

The new AP Computer Science A framework included in the course and exam description outlines distinct skills, called computational thinking practices, that students should practice throughout the year—skills that will help them learn to think and act like computer scientists.
 1. Program Design and Algorithm Development
 Determine required code segments to produce a given output.
 30%–35%
 2. Code Logic
 Determine the output, value, or result of given program code given initial values.
 40%–45%
 3. Code Implementation
 Write and implement program code.
 Not assessed in the multiple-choice section
 4. Code Testing
 Analyze program code for correctness, equivalence, and errors.
 12%–18%

###Course Type: Knowledge-based

AP Computer Science A isn’t a course that really ties to real world problems. The course is considered as a basic introduction for future courses in Computer Science and programming. More specifically, this course offers help in explaining the basic algorithms and the Java programming language. You certainly shouldn’t expect to work in big companies by simply completing the course.

###Pre-requisite course: Algebra II

I would suggest to first study Algebra II (preferably pre-Calc) before studying this course. For one it is the math concept like numbers of different bases, but also developing the logic behind computer science.


#Difficulty

###Vocabularies – 4
There really isn’t a lot of vocabulary in AP Computer Science out of the programming language itself. So most of the vocabulary is on the syntax and functions in java. With usual practices during class, one would get comfortable with them pretty soon.

###Theories – 5
Theory in AP Computer Science A is mainly about the utility of different syntax and ways to program them. For instance, what does a for loop does and in what order to write a program. So this is more of just knowing what everything and not the real implementation.

​###Application of Theories – 7
As mentioned earlier, the theories themselves tend to not be as difficult as using them in appropriate places and manner. For instance, even if you know the function of a for loop, using it in the wrong instance or in the wrong way would also make you not earn the point.

###AP Percentages – 9
In terms of AP percentages, it has one of the highest percentage of getting a five at 27% (2019) and the top few for passing at around 70% (2019).

###Workload of test – 4
Comparing to other APs, this course doesn’t require a significant amount of memorization or practice. As long as one has continuous practice on the problems, one would usually be able to get them right and thus wouldn’t take so long to prepare.
 
###Final remark on difficulty:
 For anyone with a bit of programming background, this course would be super easy. And for those of you who hadn’t done programming before but is interested, it’s not hard if you study and keep up with the pace. This is also clearly supported by the score distribution mentioned earlier in 2019.

#Tips and Resources:

- Computer Science for Dummies (or something like that)

- [www.geeksforgeeks.org](www.geeksforgeeks.org)

- AP Computer Science A Barron's Test Prep book

- There are many programming teachers outside of school; however, if you need help or want to learn more about something, you shouldn’t just go to classes. Because an essential part of computer science is to learn how to learn by yourself, through searching on internet or reading books, as it would also be a crucial skill in future school and work.
