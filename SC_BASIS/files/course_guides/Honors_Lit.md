Got As in this course 

This is a **knowledge-based** course because you will need to know what happened in books that teacher asked you to read. You will need some literary skills for doing well in this course. 

To do well, it is better if you have taken some English language or literature courses and read some serious classics. This is also a **required** course to take in 9th grade and a pre-AP course for AP English Literature in grade 10 (not offered in all schools).


###Difficulty

This course is not so hard compared to the AP Literature course. However, you will still need some serious amount of time to study for it. It is true that people with better English skills are more likely to do well and spend less time on the course. 

#Tips and Resources
A general tip is that you better read the texts in detail because the teacher will have detail-based questions on tests/quizzes. The workload of the test is manageable. If you read everyday, it will not be a lot when it comes to the night before every test/quiz. 

Though reading the assigned books is important, it is also helpful if you use some extra online resources. There are many online and here are some suggestions:
- Sparknotes.com
- LitCharts.com
- cochransclass.com, which is designed by Mrs. Cochran from BIGZ and is targeted towards students in her class

There will be essays and writing assignments. In general, they should be written in MLA format. Therefore, familiarize yourself with MLA is the key because people lose points for not attaching to the format.
