In the art studio, the relationship between students and teachers is very pleasant, we’re just like friends. Teachers help students complete projects and instruct them on their artistic skills. Here, we can not only learn art, but also practice our speeking skills and vocabulary. In this class, we mainly study graphic design and three-dimensional art creation. Although it sounds easy, the learning time of each art unit is very tight. With this efficient creative schedule, not only my art level improved, but I also have a better understanding of time management. The content of our class is not only the creation of art, but also the learning of artists and the appreciation of artworks. It can be said that the aesthetic and artistic standards of students are getting higher and better in the course of art studio. 


Some students who are not familiar with art creation can buy a teaching book about basic sketch, or search for some basic painting tutorials on youtube and bilibili. As long as you spend half an hour practicing every day, you can make significant progress in a summer vacation. There are more artistic ways to discover and create when we start school!

In the art studio, teachers will help students do better in two-dimensional painting and be creative. Teachers will teach students about art history and outstanding artists, and work with students on projects that students like. This class is very relaxing. There's a lot of work and stress on the ground, but when you're in an art studio, you don't have to think about it.
In this year's art studio study, my artistic level has been significantly improved, which is a good thing for me, because if I want to apply for an art bachelor’s degree in university or engage in art-related work in the future, the portfolio completed in art studio can help me a lot.
However, the main reason why I recommend this course is my passion for art. Art is not only a subject, but also can help people to improve their views on different styles of beauty. It can be said that art broadens people's mind and vision.
Art studio is not a simple course, on the contrary, it tests students' ability of concentration and reaction. For example, when the teacher gives a project topic, we need to quickly construct the following sketch in our mind, which tests our logical thinking in art. However, don't be discouraged if you can't do it at first, because art studio will help you think more quickly. I recommend an Art website called Saatchi Art Saatchi, which contains many kinds of Art, where students can find their favorite styles to appreciate and improve their artistic vision.
I hope everyone who loves art can find their utopia in art studio!
