worst Chinese skills in my CSL Gr. 9 Class<br>
A in CSL 8 & 9<br>

The content of this course is determined by your Chinese level, and most teachers will not force you to work above your skill level. For example, everyone in my CSL class worked on a public school grade 6 book, which included stories, poems, and old Chinese texts. This was based upon the average skill level of our class as we were all ethnically Chinese students who attended foreign or international schools that were taught in English. However, my relative lack of Chinese experience with regards to my classmates meant that my teacher would allow me to recite the poems in smaller portions rather than doing the whole poem at once, and my free response answers on tests were graded with less severity. The difficulty of this class is not too hard, but also depends on your teacher.

â€‹For Chinese in general, I find the memorization of characters difficult, and ancient Chinese writings have different meanings for certain words which pose a certain level of difficulty. There are not many resources to provide for succeeding in CSL. Success arises through working hard, expressing concerns, and seeking necessary help.
