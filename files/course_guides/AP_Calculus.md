##Experience

AP Calculus AB is an introductory calculus course that, as AP says, “cultivate students’ understanding of differential and integral calculus through engaging with real-world problems”. At the most basic level, Calculus AB involves 3 fundamental concepts: limits, differentiation, and integration. In this course, you will learn what they are, how to evaluate them, and how to apply them in real world situations. 


Before taking AP Calculus AB, you should have taken Pre-Calculus, a course that is supposed to teach you the fundamental skills needed for Calculus AB. Personally, I think the most important skill to master from Pre-Calculus before going into Calculus AB is dealing with functions. Internalizing the concept of slope at a point (increasing/decreasing), relative extremes, concavity, point of inflections, y-intercepts, x-intercepts, and end behaviors will be very useful when you analyze functions in Calculus AB, which is a big part of the course.


More advanced students might want to skip Calculus AB and go straight to Calculus BC (since Calculus BC also contains AB contents). My teacher and I, personally, do not recommend doing so. From my teacher’s understanding, colleges prefer seeing an outstanding grade on both Calculus AB and BC rather than an alright grade on only BC. Also, I believe that rushing through content is not always beneficial; diving deeper and practicing the mathematical and logical thinking is more important in the long run. 


##Preparing for the exam
Our teacher made us go through lots of past MCQs and FRQs. A lot. Doing the questions lets you realize the concepts that you need to work on, and there are tons of resources that can help you familiarize yourself with various concepts, whether it is the AP FRQ rubrics, review books, Khan Academy, or other websites. Personally, I find the AP rubrics particularly useful, especially when you have learned all the concepts. Since AP grades FRQ based on steps, reading the rubric lets you know what kinds of steps and practices AP graders are looking for. Also, because of AP’s steps-based grading system, creative problem solvers: watch out!

5 Steps to a 5: AP Calculus AB
Out of the main review books (Princeton, Barron’s, 5 Steps), I personally prefer 5 Steps. Barron’s combine AB and BC into one book, reducing the amount of details in the book. Princeton has a separate AB book, but their practice problems aren’t that useful and seem to have lots of mistakes (at least from what I saw).

Saxon’s Calculus with Trigonometry and Analytic Geometry (Not recommended)
I don’t like this textbook; it isn’t targeted towards AP Calculus AB, so it doesn’t cover some of the topics in Calculus AB, and it covers lots of topics that aren’t in Calculus AB (“Trigonometry and Analytic Geometry”). I didn’t use this book at all when I took AP Calculus AB.
