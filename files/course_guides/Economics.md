5 on AP Econ
BIPH, Class of 2022


##Introduction
Generally micro and macroeconomics are taught in a school year (at least that’s how we did in BIPH), which tells you that these two courses shouldn’t be too hard. The truth is they are not super hard as you can see from their 5 rate which are both around 20%. What does 20% mean? Compared to other subjects that I took such as Human Geography (10%) and Physics 1 (6.2%), that means if your Econ teacher is unfortunately not so good at teaching, you are capable of self studying AP economics, which I highly suggest as well. It also means how much time you want to invest on this subject if you have multiple APs in a year.​

##Resources
The best resource is a website called ACDC Econ. This year our economics teacher bought the learning materials from ACDC called the “Ultimate Review Packet” as our homework and used its powerpoint to teach us. I found it even more efficient if I just watch Jacob Clifford’s (the founder of ACDC) videos directly. 
I saw an answer from Quora which basically says what I wanted to say about ACDC Econ.

Something to note, not all his videos are free. You can only watch some videos if you buy his review packet. Even so, the price of micro or macro packet is $12 and $20 for both, which is still much cheaper than a full length tutoring class off-campus. If you want to get a 5 in the AP exam, ACDC Econ is really a good choice. 

The last step is always to do a past years’ AP test! College Board usually only releases a few practice exams at a time. Princeton and Barron's have their own practice questions but the difficulty level is inconsistent with the actual AP test.

##More advanced
If you are really interested in Economics and want to learn more than just for exams, these books and websites are highly recommended:

- "The Wealth of Nations", Adam Smith
    My classmate who attended the National Economic Challenge recommended it to me. This book is quite well-known in the Economic field and it can provide you a clear insight of how Adam Smith’s theory works. It includes much more than what our text book and the exam covers.

- "Freakonomics", Steven D. Levitt & Stephen J. Dubner
    “Freakonomics” is a book that focuses less on the mathematical aspect of economic and emphasizes more on how economics influences our daily life. It has a lot of interesting stories to demonstrate how economics can have numerous unexpected relationships with psychology and sociology.
   
- "The Economist"
    The Economist is a good way to learn more about the business/political leaders and current international events. The language it uses is understandable to even an Econ beginner but the content is educational to anyone.
