Honors Biology is a course prior to AP Biology that you must take in order to graduate. In Honors Biology, the dominant skill required for you is to learn not just fast but effectively (meaning that you must be able to truly "digest" them and use them whenever necessary). This skill is especially important for Biology because the core themes in Biology overlap, and throughout the course you will also need to be able to apply the old concepts from previous units into new concepts. This is what makes Biology such a special course: everything is connected, and you will always base your new learning on the existing foundations.

##Some concepts in Honors Biology:
- Scientific Knowledge
- Scientific Methods
- Statistics
- Laboratory Equipment
- Biochemistry
- Cell Structure, Function, and Transport
- Cellular Respiration and Photosynthesis
- â€‹Fermentation
- Cell Division
- Mitosis
- Meiosis
- Cancer
- DNA, RNA, and Gene Expression
- Genetics and Biotechnology
- Evolution


Honors Biology might be overwhelming for you at the start, but do not panic. You will find yourself improving as you progress in the year. One good strategy to succeed in Honors Biology is to keep practicing and organizing new vocabularies you receive. Use flashcards! Ask your friend to quiz you! Go to Quizlet! Whatever you think is helpful. Personally, I also recommend you to get a digital or light paperback version of the textbook. In this way, you can study the concepts both in class and in dorm without actually bringing the book every day.

Overall, as long as you work hard and believe in yourself, Honors Biology shouldn't be a problem to you at all :)
