#How to win:
​​
**Winning by weighing**: maybe you've totally lost your case, but you can still win by bringing forward more impact. So always remember to weigh (word used in debate that means compare impacts) through the five weighing mechanisms:
    - Magnitude
    - Scope
    - Probability
    - Reversibility
    - Timeframe
**Winning with evidence**: state all your standing evidence in the final focus to backup your claim and make yourself more credible, while pointing out that the other team has provided insufficient amounts of evidence or evidence that is not credible.

#Personal Tips:
##​Preparing for a debate:
###Constructive speeches:

1. Write your arguments before writing the speech and then piece them together, this makes speech writing much easier.

2. Time your constructive speech before the debate and calculate how many words you can read per minute, so when you are writing a rebuttal you can roughly estimate how much you need to cut down to stay within the 4 minute time limit. The same goes for summary speakers (people who speak first out of the two on the same team)- you can estimate how long your summary speech should be.
<br>

###For those who want to learn debate fast:

1. Learn to flow a speech (type really fast while listening to a speech on youtube)
2. Write blocks (counter-arguments) towards your own arguments and towards arguments that will come up in the debate, so at that time you can just copy and paste.
3. Do a Devil's Advocate (guide)

<br>

###During the debate:

1. **Know your judge.** Ask for the judge's preferences and their occupation in a respectful way, for example saying, “What has brought you here to judge us today?”, “Do you specialize in the topic?”
2. **Ask for evidence.** whenever things seem sketchy, especially in pre-elimination rounds. That way you can look it up yourself, there was one round in TOC where a team told us that they had this perfect technology called CRISPR Pro, that had absolutely no flaws, we knew something was wrong because we had never read about or heard about this technology, so we asked for evidence. They said that they would “read their evidence in the summary speech” however they never did and after the round we found that it was fake evidence. Thus you should never believe a team when they say they will read something for you. When they can’t provide context to a text, you can also call them out for paraphrasing. Moreover if the author of the text has no qualifications, you can also call them out for that, stating that it has no reliability. After checking for evidence do not call them out on the spot, bring our misuse of evidence in your next speech.
3. **The rules for asking for evidence**, is that the prep time doesn't start until the person pulls out the evidence and puts it before you, during the time that the opponent is finding the evidence, no one is allowed to have prep. New NSDA rules have allowed us to use Wifi, and thus it is better to let the opponents open the original page. (This is something that a lot of judges are not familiar with.)
4. **Tell the judge what to do in your speech**: e.g “judge delete their argument from the flow”, “thus their argument is completely irrelevant to today’s round” and so on…
5. **Always weigh** arguments based on the five mechanisms: magnitude, scope, probability, reversibility and timeframe. (Some mechanisms will vary depending on where you learnt debate. I learnt these mechanisms at Havard Debate Council Summer Workshops). Please use this template when beginning: “Our environment argument outweighs their economic benefit argument based on reversibility, because once we destroy our environment it can’t come back, and based on timeframe, because before we get any economic benefits we have to destroy the environment, thus in comparison judge the world is better off on our side with a prolonged environment.​

<br>

#Crossfire:
1. **Ask close-ended questions**. The purpose of the crossfire is to get a consensus, thus you should ask yes or no questions, where the answers are very obvious and not beneficial for their side. Once you have gotten the consensus, say thank you and move on. Don't push them into a corner, chances are they will realize their mistake. The consensus can then be used in your rebuttal/summary/final focus speech: "The con team has admitted that..., thus they agree that... which disproves their argument/proves our point"
2. **Ask prewritten questions**, it makes you look more confident.
3. **During the crossfire**, it is NOT a time to debate, don't bring up arguments that both sides have the same probability of winning, use around 30 secs per question, if time goes over, move on.
4. Do **NOT** ask the question "Can you explain your XXX contention?" without consulting your partner, or else the opponents team will get a huge amount of time to explain and extend their argument.
5. You may also **question sources** during this time: "What is your source that 47% of Bitcoin is used for crime? because our evidence is from University of Sydney."

#​Extra Tips

By Edward Luo<br>
NSDA 2020 TOC 2nd Place Team<br>

This section is meant to supplement my partner Anthea's tips above for progressing in debate, since she discussed a lot of practical aspects of debate, I will emphasize some ways to accelerate your learning.

##Sharing Evidence
When we have teams from the same school it often helps to share evidence; of course you want to have an advantage against your other teams, but unless you are all guaranteed to be in the top teams, it makes much more sense to be sharing evidence and rebuttals to different pieces of evidence. Evidence sharing can help you cut down on researching time, which is the most tedious part of debate. It is thanks to my friends who were already in debate for sharing their resources with me that I could get 2nd place at the NSDA TOC despite it being my 4th ever round.

##Reflection
Judges will give you suggestions on how to change your debate style to be better. Certainly, sometimes judges will not have as much experience and will not give you very good feedback. However, this also serves as a reminder that every judge is different and look for different things, so be aware of the difference between what are objective aspects that you can improve on versus aspects which certain judges will subjectively prefer and which you should ask for before the debate.

##Time Management at Events
There are several options that you have in between debate rounds; you can work on your case, rest, or observe other debaters. I personally found that working on my case and resting when I felt the need to was the most beneficial for improving my performance at the specific event. However, observing debates is a useful tool in improving your own skills and will benefit you in the long run. That being said, I do not recommend going to everyone’s round, but I would suggest finding out who are the strongest debaters at your event and go watch some of their debates if you have time.
