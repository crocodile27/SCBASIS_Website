I’ve been in World Scholars Cup for more than a year and participated four rounds total: in two regional rounds, Malaysia’s global round and Tournament Of Champions.

WSC needs cooperation, so if you want a bunch of trophies at the end, every single one of your teammates must have two qualities: 1. be good at debate and 2. be devoted, and willing to make and read 200-page study guides. In other words if you want to win, then you need a really strong team; signing up as a solo scholar is not the best choice. This is NOT an introduction to WSC, but tips to doing well. If you want more on the rules of the tournament, please visit their official website: scholarscup.org

##​Challenge:
This is my favorite part of WSC, because it really is a great learning experience, and all the knowledge on the website can be applied to all subjects, I’ve always been the one in my classes to go like awwww, I’ve seen him before isn’t he the guy who negotiated with America to stop the Vietnam war, and for people with great memory it’s your time to shine. My preparation way is making study guides, that makes it much easier to review as not all of the websites have links and BASIS students know why it’s better to have stuff on paper and not on a computer.

##Debate
Bring a laptop. Paper and pen to flow (Taking notes in debate is called flowing). Tips to win: 1. Tell a story, judges love stories or jokes or very detailed examples. 2. Ask the judge for a paradigm, like what he/she would like to see in the debate, if he tells you all debate specific terms he is probably a professional judge, otherwise it is usually a parent or teacher, this it is more important to use analogies, stories. 3. If you are a beginner at debate, read something difficult out loud at a fast pace before the round so it minimizes the stutter that nervousness gives you. 4. End on a strong note, so it shows that you believe in what you say. 5. Do communicate a lot with your teammates to show that you are all on the same page and not making contradicting arguments but also communication points are counted in WSC debate, so even if you don’t have anything to say during that one minute, whisper encouragement into your partner's ears. 6. Don’t talk while the opponent's team is, or else they might run the “WSC no talking during debate theory” against you, and take off your points. If they are rude, and talk while you do, you can win the debate by running this theory, but I wouldn’t advise it as it is always better to win with skill.

##Writing:
This part is where you have to get as creative as possible. Try imagining a judge that has to skim through 200 essays, you need to hook them into your essay, and you need to have some humor or unique story to tell. If you are trying to advocate for something than make your arguments as unique as possible, for example we had a topic about google maps adopting the ancient day maps. My friend wrote about the colors of the ancient maps protecting your eyes and she got a gold medal in Global rounds for writing. This year in Hong Kong, one of the topics was about a time traveler so I wrote a story of Hong Kong being colonized and a discriminated yellow-skinned person walking into movie theater that had a movie called “a travel in time” and then walking into the theater to find that he had traveled to the modern day Hong Kong and how society’s view of Hong Kong had changed through the advancement of technology and accumulation of capital. I got 5th and our team got 2nd in writing overall. Just try and be as creative as possible. Use hooks and quotes! ​

##Scholar’s Bowl:
I would advise the three of you to split up and study two subjects really well, six if you can manage and then during the Scholar’s Bowl you will have around 10-15 seconds to make a decision. During this very short time period first identify the subject and then let your teammate who knows the answer the question. If you know the answer, voice it, and believe in your partners. Always learn to forgive your partners if they make a mistake, as everyone does that.

WSC is a competition that stresses enjoying the process of learning. Global rounds and the tournament of champions, which are the second and third stages often include more fun activities such as scavenger hunts, author visits, dances, and similar events apart from testing, writing, and debating. Due to this fun aspect, WSC may commonly be viewed as a less “college-application-worthy” but also a more fun and stress-free experience when compared to other competitions.
